# CHIP8 Emulator

CHIP8 Emulator developed in C++, with SDL2 for Graphics and Keyboard support. Currently does not support sound, but everything else should work fine!

### Running the Emulator:
----------------------
Any ROM you wish to run must be in the .ch8 format and be placed in the ROMS/ folder. Then edit the path in main.cpp ( I really should make this a commandline argument.. ) and run:

```cpp
  make run  
```
